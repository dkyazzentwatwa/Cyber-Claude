- Security best practices validation
- Compliance checking (GDPR, data protection, etc.)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Proposed API
class SafetyValidator {
  async validatePlan(plan: Plan): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // Check for high-risk operations
    // Validate target domains against blocklist
    // Calculate risk score
    // Enforce rate limits
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

**Use Cases:**
- Security audit reports
- Penetration test deliverables
- Compliance documentation
- Client presentations
- Internal security reviews

**Implementation:**

## 🔮 Advanced Features (Medium Term)

### 4. Multi-Agent Collaboration
**Status:** Research Phase
**Priority:** Low
**Description:** Multiple autonomous agents working together on complex tasks

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────┐

└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    ▼         ▼
┌────────┐ ┌────────┐
│Agent 1 │ │Agent 2 │
│(Recon) │ │(Exploit)│
└────────┘ └────────┘
```

**Use Cases:**
- Parallel vulnerability scanning across multiple targets
- Red team operations with coordinated attack phases
- Large-scale OSINT investigations
- Distributed security monitoring

**Challenges:**
- Agent communication protocol
- Work distribution algorithm
- Result aggregation
- Resource management
- Cost control with multiple API calls

### 5. Learning from History
**Status:** Research Phase
**Priority:** Low
**Description:** Improve plans based on past execution data

**Features:**
- Execution history database
- Success/failure pattern recognition
- Tool performance analytics
- Optimal plan suggestions based on similar tasks
- Anomaly detection for unexpected results

**Implementation Approach:**
```typescript
interface ExecutionHistory {
  task: Task;
  plan: Plan;
  results: ExecutionResult;
  successRate: number;
  duration: number;
  findings: SecurityFinding[];
  timestamp: Date;
}

class LearningEngine {
  async suggestPlan(task: Task): Promise<Plan> {
    // Query similar tasks from history
    // Analyze success patterns
    // Suggest optimized plan
  }

  async analyzePerformance(): Promise<PerformanceMetrics> {
    // Tool success rates
    // Average durations
    // Finding patterns
  }
}
```

### 6. Custom Workflows
**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** User-defined task templates and automation recipes

**Features:**
- Workflow templates (YAML/JSON format)
- Parameterized workflows
- Conditional logic support
- Loop constructs for iterative tasks
- Error handling strategies
- Workflow marketplace/sharing

**Example Workflow:**
```yaml
name: "WordPress Security Audit"
description: "Comprehensive WordPress site security assessment"
parameters:
  - name: target_url
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: scan_depth
    type: string
    default: "standard"

  - name: "Technology Detection"
    tool: recon
    parameters:
      target: "${target_url}"
      depth: "quick"

    parameters:
      url: "${target_url}"
      enumerate: ["vp", "vt", "u"]

  - name: "Vulnerability Scan"
    tool: nuclei
    parameters:
      target: "${target_url}"

  --alert-on "critical,high" \
  --notify "security@example.com" \
  --baseline-compare
```

---

## 📝 Notes

### Why Not Implemented Yet?

These features are not yet implemented because:

1. **Core system first** - We focused on getting the foundational agentic system solid before adding enhancements
2. **Real-world validation** - We want to gather user feedback on core features before building advanced capabilities
3. **Resource constraints** - Each feature requires significant development and testing time
4. **Iterative approach** - Better to have a working core system than incomplete advanced features

### Feedback Welcome

We'd love to hear your thoughts on these features:
- Which are most valuable to you?
- What other features would you like to see?
- Any concerns about the proposed implementations?

## How It Works Technically

### 1. System Prompt Composition

**Location:** `src/agent/core.ts:46-50`

```typescript
private getSystemPrompt(mode: AgentMode): string {
  const basePrompt = SYSTEM_PROMPTS.base;        // Always included
  const modePrompt = SYSTEM_PROMPTS[mode] || ''; // Mode-specific
  return modePrompt ? `${basePrompt}\n\n${modePrompt}` : basePrompt;
}
```

The agent **combines two prompts**:
- **Base Prompt**: Core constraints and capabilities (defensive operations only, no exploitation, etc.)
- **Mode Prompt**: Specialized focus and perspective for the selected mode

### 2. Mode Switching

**Location:** `src/agent/core.ts:106-110`

```typescript
setMode(mode: AgentMode): void {
  this.mode = mode;
  this.systemPrompt = this.getSystemPrompt(mode); // Regenerate system prompt
  logger.info(`Agent mode changed to ${mode}`);
}
```

When you switch modes:
- The system prompt is regenerated with the new mode's instructions
- **Conversation history is preserved** - the AI remembers previous exchanges
- The AI's personality and focus shift to match the new mode

### 3. Base Constraints (Always Applied)

**Location:** `src/agent/prompts/system.ts`

Every mode inherits these ethical constraints:
- ✅ **Defensive Operations Only** - Never perform actual exploitation
- ✅ **No Credential Harvesting** - Do not collect, store, or exfiltrate credentials
- ✅ **Safe Mode** - Always prioritize system safety and user consent
- ✅ **Transparency** - Explain what you're doing and why
- ✅ **Ethical** - Follow responsible disclosure and security ethics

- Provide remediation recommendations
- Maintain ethical boundaries
```

### Example Conversation

```bash
$ cyber-claude interactive --mode redteam
Mode: redteam | Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5

⚔️ [redteam] > scan network
✓ Network scan completed: 47 connections found

⚔️ [redteam] > Analyze these from an attacker's perspective
💭 From a red team perspective, here are the attack vectors:

**Initial Access Opportunities (T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application):**
- Port 8080 exposed on 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) - likely dev server
  ➜ Attack vector: Direct access from internet if router forwards port
  ➜ Risk: Unauthenticated access to development endpoints
  ➜ Enumeration: Banner grabbing reveals Node.js/Express

- No firewall filtering on inbound connections
  ➜ All ports accessible to local network
  ➜ No defense against local threat actors

**Discovery (T1046 - Network Service Discovery):**
- Multiple outbound HTTPS connections reveal your tech stack:
  ➜ github.com → Git usage, potential for credential harvesting if .git exposed
  ➜ npmjs.org → Node.js development, dependency confusion attacks possible
  ➜ docker.io → Container usage, look for exposed Docker socket (2375/tcp)

**Credential Access (T1552 - Unsecured Credentials):**
- Development server on 8080 may expose:
  ➜ Environment variables via /env endpoints
  ➜ API keys in client-side JavaScript
  ➜ Debug information with internal paths

**Recommended Blue Team Countermeasures:**
1. Bind dev server to 127.0.0.1 ONLY (not 0.0.0.0)
2. Enable macOS firewall in stealth mode
3. Use VPN for development traffic to mask reconnaissance
4. Implement network segmentation (dev network ≠ production)
5. Add authentication to all dev endpoints

⚔️ [redteam] > mode blueteam
✓ Switched to blueteam mode

🛡️ [blueteam] > How would I detect the issues you just identified?
💭 To detect these as a blue team operator...
[Defensive strategies follow]
```

### Use Cases
- ✅ Pre-deployment security assessments
- ✅ Red team exercises
- ✅ Vulnerability research
- ✅ Attack surface enumeration
- ✅ Understanding attacker TTPs
- ✅ Risk modeling and threat assessment

### MITRE ATT&CK Integration
Red team mode automatically maps findings to ATT&CK techniques when using `--mitre` flag:
- T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application
- T1046: Network Service Discovery
- T1552: Unsecured Credentials
- T1078: Valid Accounts
- And 16+ more techniques

**Traffic Summary:**
- Total packets: 15,847
- Suspicious connections: 12
- Unique external IPs: 8

🛡️ [blueteam] > What IOCs should I prioritize?
💭 Based on the traffic analysis, prioritize these IOCs in order:

**🔴 CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required:**

1. **IP: 185.220.101.45** (127 connections to port 9001)
   - Classification: Known Tor exit node
   - Behavior: Regular beaconing every 60 seconds
   - Risk: C2 communication channel
   - Action:
     ✓ Isolate host from network immediately
     ✓ Check EDR for process initiating connections
     ✓ Search SIEM for other hosts contacting this IP

2. **Domain: updatecheck.evil.com** (23 DNS queries)
   - Classification: Newly registered domain (<7 days old)
   - Behavior: DNS tunneling pattern (long TXT records)
   - Risk: Data exfiltration via DNS
   - Action:
     ✓ Block domain at DNS resolver
     ✓ Analyze DNS query payload for encoded data
     ✓ Review firewall logs for associated IPs

**🟠 HIGH - Investigate Within 24 Hours:**

3. **IP: 192.168.1.105** (Port scan detected)
   - Scanned ports: 22, 23, 3389, 445, 1433, 3306
   - Risk: Internal reconnaissance
   - Action: Identify host, check for unauthorized access

**Detection Rules to Deploy:**

```yaml
# Splunk
index=firewall dest_ip="185.220.101.45"
| stats count by src_ip
| where count > 10

# Sigma Rule
title: Tor Exit Node Communication
detection:
  selection:
    destination_ip: '185.220.101.45'
    destination_port: 9001
  condition: selection
```

Mode: desktopsecurity | Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5

🔒 [desktopsecurity] > scan full
✓ Full system scan completed

**Your Mac Security Status:**

✅ **Good:**
- macOS 14.1 (latest version)
- Firewall enabled
- Gatekeeper active
- Automatic updates on

⚠️ **Needs Attention:**
- FileVault: ❌ Disabled
- Firewall stealth mode: ❌ Off
- 47 processes running (12 unknown)

📊 **Details:**
- 12 network connections active
- 247 GB free space / 500 GB total
- Last backup: 3 days ago (Time Machine)

🔒 [desktopsecurity] > Why is FileVault important for my laptop?
💭 FileVault is macOS's full-disk encryption. Here's why it matters for YOUR laptop:

**🎯 Real-World Scenario:**

Imagine you're at a coffee shop and your MacBook is stolen. Without FileVault:

❌ **What the thief can do:**
1. Boot your Mac from a USB drive (bypasses login screen)
2. Mount your hard drive and copy ALL your files:
   - Your photos and documents
   - Saved passwords in Chrome/Safari
   - Your SSH keys and API tokens
   - Your Messages history
   - Your browser cookies (can hijack logged-in sessions)
3. Sell your data on the dark web
4. Use your credentials to access your accounts

✅ **With FileVault enabled:**
1. Thief boots from USB drive
2. Your drive shows up as encrypted gibberish
3. Without your login password, data is unreadable
4. Even removing the SSD and reading it elsewhere = still encrypted
5. Your data remains safe 🔒

**💻 Technical Details (if you're curious):**
- Encryption: XTS-AES-128 (military-grade)
- Key derivation: Your login password + hardware key in T2/M-series chip
- Brute force protection: Hardware-enforced rate limiting

**⚡ Performance Impact:**
- Modern Macs (2018+): **ZERO performance hit**
- Why? Hardware encryption in T2/M-series chips
- Encryption/decryption happens in dedicated hardware
- You won't notice any difference in speed

**⏱️ Setup Time:**
- Initial encryption: 1-2 hours (use Mac normally during this)
- After setup: Completely transparent, no maintenance needed

**📝 How to Enable:**
1. System Settings → Privacy & Security → FileVault
2. Click "Turn On FileVault"
3. Choose recovery method (iCloud or recovery key)
4. Let it encrypt in background

**⚠️ Important:** Save your recovery key somewhere safe (password manager,
printed and stored securely). Without it and your password, your data is gone.

🔒 [desktopsecurity] > What about the firewall stealth mode?
💭 Stealth mode makes your Mac "invisible" on networks. Here's what it does:

**Normal Firewall:**
- Someone pings your Mac → Mac responds "I'm here but ports are closed"
- Port scanner sees your Mac exists → may target you

**Stealth Mode:**
- Someone pings your Mac → *crickets* (no response)
- Your Mac appears offline to port scanners
- Harder for attackers to even know you exist on the network

**When it matters:**
- ✅ Coffee shops, airports, hotels (untrusted networks)
- ✅ Conferences, coworking spaces
- ❌ Home network (usually fine without it)

**Enable:** System Settings → Network → Firewall → Options →
            ☑️ "Enable stealth mode"
```

### Use Cases
- ✅ Personal laptop/desktop security
- ✅ Privacy-focused users
- ✅ Non-technical users needing guidance
- ✅ Home office security
- ✅ Security awareness training
- ✅ Family computer protection

### Educational Approach
Desktop security mode excels at:
- **Explaining the "why"** behind recommendations
- **Real-world scenarios** to illustrate risks
- **Balancing security with usability** - won't suggest impractical measures
- **Step-by-step guidance** with exact menu paths
- **Privacy considerations** beyond just security

```

### Example Conversation

```bash
$ cyber-claude interactive --mode webpentest
Mode: webpentest | Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5

🌐 [webpentest] > webscan https://staging.myapp.local --full

⚠️  AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Target: https://staging.myapp.local

Do you have explicit permission to scan this target? yes
Is this a production environment? no
Is this for a CTF/educational challenge? no

✓ Authorization confirmed

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ Web scan completed

**Findings Summary:**
  Total: 5
  🔴 Critical: 0
  🟠 High: 2
  🟡 Medium: 3
  🟢 Low: 0
  🔵 Info: 0

**HIGH Severity:**
🟠 Missing CSRF Protection on State-Changing Endpoints
🟠 Session Cookie Without Secure Flag

**MEDIUM Severity:**
🟡 Missing Content-Security-Policy Header
🟡 X-Frame-Options Not Set (Clickjacking Risk)
🟡 Permissive CORS Configuration

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🌐 [webpentest] > Explain the CSRF vulnerability in detail
💭 **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Deep Dive:**

**🔍 What I Found:**
Your application has POST endpoints that:
- Accept state-changing requests (login, transfer, delete)
- Rely ONLY on session cookies for authentication
- Have NO CSRF tokens or additional verification

**Vulnerable Endpoints Detected:**
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/account/transfer
- POST /api/settings/update
- DELETE /api/account/close

**🎯 Attack Scenario (Step-by-Step):**

1. **Victim's Action:** User logs into staging.myapp.local
   → Browser stores session cookie: sessionId=abc123

2. **Attacker's Setup:** Creates malicious page at evil.com:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <body>
     <h1>You Won a Prize!</h1>
     <img src="cute-cat.jpg">

     <!-- Hidden malicious form -->
     <form id="attack" action="https://staging.myapp.local/api/account/transfer"
           method="POST" style="display:none">
       <input name="to" value="attacker@evil.com">
       <input name="amount" value="1000">
     </form>

     <script>
       // Auto-submit when page loads
       document.getElementById('attack').submit();
     </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Victim Visits:** User clicks link to evil.com while still logged in

4. **Browser Behavior:**
   - Sees form targeting staging.myapp.local
   - Automatically includes session cookie (same domain)
   - Submits POST request as the victim

5. **Server Response:**
   - Validates session cookie ✓ (it's valid!)
   - No CSRF token check ✗ (doesn't exist)
   - Executes transfer as victim
   - Money sent to attacker

**💥 Real-World Impact:**
- Unauthorized money transfers
- Account takeover via email/password changes
- Data deletion
- Privilege escalation
- Social engineering amplification

**🛡️ Remediation (Priority Order):**

**1. Implement CSRF Tokens (Synchronizer Token Pattern):**

```javascript
// Backend (Express.js)
const csrf = require('csurf');
const csrfProtection = csrf({ cookie: true });

app.get('/form', csrfProtection, (req, res) => {
  res.render('form', { csrfToken: req.csrfToken() });
});

app.post('/api/account/transfer', csrfProtection, (req, res) => {
  // CSRF token automatically validated
  // Will return 403 if token missing/invalid
  processTransfer(req.body);
});
```

```html
<!-- Frontend -->
<form method="POST" action="/api/account/transfer">
  <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="{{ csrfToken }}">
  <input name="amount" value="100">
  <button type="submit">Transfer</button>
</form>
```

**2. Set SameSite Cookie Attribute:**

```javascript
// Session cookie configuration
app.use(session({
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  cookie: {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: true,        // HTTPS only
    sameSite: 'strict'   // Prevents cross-site cookie sending
  }
}));
```

SameSite values:
- `strict` - Cookie NEVER sent cross-site (most secure)
- `lax` - Cookie sent on top-level navigation (safer default)
- `none` - Cookie always sent (requires Secure flag)

**3. Verify Origin/Referer Headers:**

```javascript
app.post('/api/*', (req, res, next) => {
  const origin = req.get('origin');
  const referer = req.get('referer');

  const allowedOrigins = ['https://staging.myapp.local'];

  if (origin && !allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden origin' });
  }

  next();
});
```

**4. Require Re-authentication for Sensitive Actions:**

```javascript
app.post('/api/account/close', async (req, res) => {
  // Require password confirmation for critical actions
  const passwordValid = await verifyPassword(
    req.user.id,
    req.body.password
  );

  if (!passwordValid) {
    return res.status(401).json({
      error: 'Password confirmation required'
    });
  }

  closeAccount(req.user.id);
});
```

- CWE-352: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html
- OWASP Top 10 2021 - A01:2021 Broken Access Control

**🧪 Testing & Verification:**
After implementing fixes, test with:
1. Browser DevTools - check for CSRF token in forms
2. curl - attempt POST without token (should fail)
3. Different browser - try cross-origin request (should fail)

🕵️ [osint] > Analyze the attack surface
💭 **Attack Surface Analysis from OSINT Data:**

**🎯 External Attack Vectors Identified:**

**1. Subdomain Takeover Risk (MEDIUM)**
- Found 3 subdomains with CNAME records pointing to external services:
  ➜ blog.example.com → example.ghost.io (Ghost.io)
  ➜ help.example.com → example.zendesk.com (Zendesk)
  ➜ docs.example.com → example-docs.s3.amazonaws.com (AWS S3)
- Risk: If these third-party accounts are closed or DNS misconfigured,
  attacker could claim the subdomain
- Verify: Check if third-party accounts still exist and are owned by you

**2. Information Disclosure (MEDIUM)**
- 8 email addresses exposed publicly:
  ➜ Enables targeted phishing campaigns
  ➜ Username enumeration for authentication attacks
  ➜ Social engineering data gathering
- Detected email patterns: firstname.lastname@example.com
  ➜ Attacker can guess additional valid emails

**3. Legacy Infrastructure (LOW-MEDIUM)**
- FTP subdomain still exists (ftp.example.com)
  ➜ FTP is insecure by default (no encryption)
  ➜ Investigate if still in use or can be decommissioned
- Apache version disclosed in headers: 2.4.50
  ➜ Check for CVEs against this specific version
  ➜ Consider hiding version in server headers

**4. Third-Party Dependencies (MEDIUM)**
- Reliance on external CDN (Cloudflare)
  ➜ Single point of failure
  ➜ If Cloudflare account compromised, entire site at risk
- Ghost.io blog hosting
  ➜ Blog content could be modified if Ghost account compromised

**5. Historical Exposure (INFO)**
- 28 years of Wayback Machine snapshots
  ➜ May contain leaked credentials, API keys in old source code
  ➜ Shows evolution of infrastructure (useful for attacker reconnaissance)
  ➜ Recommended: Review old snapshots for sensitive data leaks

**🛡️ Defensive Recommendations:**

1. **Subdomain Monitoring**
   - Implement continuous subdomain monitoring
   - Verify CNAME targets are still controlled by your organization
   - Consider wildcard DNS records with catchall pages

2. **Email Protection**
   - Use email obfuscation on public pages
   - Implement DMARC/SPF/DKIM to prevent email spoofing
   - Train employees on phishing (emails are now public)

3. **Legacy Cleanup**
   - Audit all subdomains for active use
   - Decommission unused services (especially FTP)
   - Remove version disclosure from HTTP headers

4. **Third-Party Risk**
   - Document all third-party dependencies
   - Enable 2FA on all third-party accounts
   - Regular access reviews for external services

5. **Historical Data**
   - Request removal of sensitive snapshots from Wayback Machine
   - Scan old snapshots for exposed credentials/API keys
   - Add robots.txt rules to prevent future archiving if needed

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 1. Conversation History is Preserved

When you switch modes, the AI **remembers** previous exchanges:

```bash
🤖 [base] > What process is running on port 8080?
💭 It's a Node.js development server (Express.js)

🤖 [base] > mode redteam
✓ Switched to redteam mode

⚔️ [redteam] > Is that port secure?
💭 No, the Node.js server on port 8080 is exposed on 0.0.0.0...
    ↑ AI remembers "that port" refers to 8080
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Conversation history stored in `CyberAgent.conversationHistory[]`
- Array of `ConversationMessage` objects (role + content)
- Preserved across mode switches (only system prompt changes)
- Cleared only when explicitly requested (`clear` command)

### 2. Base Constraints Always Apply

Every mode inherits the base ethical constraints from `SYSTEM_PROMPTS.base`:

- ❌ **No actual exploitation**
- ❌ **No credential harvesting**
- ❌ **No malicious operations**
- ✅ **Defensive operations only**
- ✅ **User consent required**
- ✅ **Transparency in actions**
- ✅ **Educational focus**

Even in "redteam" mode, the AI simulates an attacker's **perspective** without actually attacking.

### 3. Modes Don't Change Tools, Just Perspective

All modes have access to the same commands (`scan`, `webscan`, `pcap`, `harden`), but they **analyze and explain** results differently.

**Example: Same network scan, different mode responses**

| Mode | Response Style |
|------|----------------|
| **base** | "You have 47 network connections. 3 are to port 443 (HTTPS) which is normal. Port 8080 is listening on all interfaces - consider binding to localhost only for development servers." |
| **redteam** | "Attack surface includes exposed dev server on 0.0.0.0:8080 (T1190). No firewall filtering detected. OS fingerprinting possible via TTL values. Recommend enumerate /api endpoints for information disclosure." |
| **blueteam** | "Monitoring priorities: (1) Alert on port 8080 external connections, (2) Baseline normal HTTPS destinations for anomaly detection, (3) Enable firewall with default-deny policy. No active threats detected." |
| **desktopsecurity** | "Your Mac has 47 network connections, which is normal. Port 8080 is a development server - make sure it's only for local testing (it should be 127.0.0.1:8080, not 0.0.0.0:8080). Enable your firewall in System Settings for extra protection." |
| **webpentest** | "Port 8080 detected - likely web server. Test for: (1) Directory traversal (../ in paths), (2) Default credentials if admin panel, (3) Information disclosure (/server-status, /.git), (4) Security headers missing. Run `webscan` for detailed analysis." |

### 4. Mode Selection is Flexible

You can:
- ✅ Switch modes mid-conversation
- ✅ Switch modes multiple times
- ✅ Use different modes for different commands in same session
- ✅ Combine modes (e.g., redteam → blueteam workflow)

### 5. Provider-Agnostic

Modes work identically across both AI providers:
- **Claude** (Anthropic) - All 5 modes supported
- **Gemini** (Google) - All 5 modes supported
- System prompts are provider-agnostic
- Switch models without losing mode context

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Multi-Mode Workflows

**Red Team → Blue Team Combo:**
```bash
# Find vulnerabilities from attacker perspective
⚔️ [redteam] > scan network
⚔️ [redteam] > Analyze attack surface
💭 [Lists vulnerabilities and attack paths]

# Switch to defensive perspective
⚔️ [redteam] > mode blueteam

# Get defensive strategies
🛡️ [blueteam] > How do I defend against what you just found?
💭 [Provides detection rules, hardening steps, monitoring guidance]
```

**Web Pentest → Red Team Escalation:**
```bash
# Test web application
🌐 [webpentest] > webscan https://app.example.com --full
💭 [Finds SQLi vulnerability in /api/search]

# Escalate to infrastructure assessment
🌐 [webpentest] > mode redteam

# Analyze broader attack chain
⚔️ [redteam] > If SQLi is exploitable, what's the attack path?
💭 [Maps: SQLi → Database access → Credential theft → Lateral movement]
```

### 2. Context Preservation

Reference previous findings across modes:
```bash
🤖 [base] > pcap capture.pcap --extract-iocs
💭 [Extracts 47 IOCs]

🤖 [base] > mode blueteam
✓ Switched to blueteam mode

🛡️ [blueteam] > Create SIEM rules for those IOCs
💭 [Generates Splunk/Sigma rules for the 47 IOCs extracted earlier]
                    ↑ AI remembers "those IOCs"
```

### 3. Mode-Specific Features

Some flags work best with specific modes:

| Flag | Best Mode | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| `--extract-iocs` | blueteam | Defensive IOC tracking |
| `--mitre` | redteam or blueteam | Attack/defense technique mapping |
| `--preserve-evidence` | blueteam | Forensic chain of custody |
| `--nuclei` | webpentest | Web vulnerability scanning |
| `--ctf` | webpentest | CTF-specific authorization |

### 4. Learning with Base Mode

Use `base` mode to learn before switching to specialized modes:
```bash
🤖 [base] > What is CSRF?
💭 [Educational explanation of CSRF]

🤖 [base] > mode webpentest
✓ Switched to webpentest mode

🌐 [webpentest] > webscan https://example.com
💭 [Finds CSRF vulnerability - you now understand what it means!]
```

### 5. Quick Mode Reference

Keep this handy:
```bash

└── session.ts                 # InteractiveSession with mode switching
```

### Type Definition

**Location:** `src/agent/types.ts`

```typescript
export type AgentMode = 'base' | 'redteam' | 'blueteam' | 'desktopsecurity' | 'webpentest' | 'osint';

export interface AgentConfig {
  mode: AgentMode;
  apiKey?: string;           // Anthropic API key
  googleApiKey?: string;     // Google API key
  model?: string;            // Model ID
  maxTokens?: number;
}
```

### Code Examples

**Creating an agent with a specific mode:**
```typescript
import { CyberAgent } from './agent/core.js';

const agent = new CyberAgent({
  mode: 'redteam',
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  googleApiKey: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY,
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5',
});

// Use the agent
const response = await agent.chat('Analyze this network scan');
```

**Switching modes programmatically:**
```typescript
// Start in base mode
const agent = new CyberAgent({ mode: 'base', apiKey: '...' });

// Analyze normally
await agent.chat('What are the security issues?');

// Switch to red team perspective
agent.setMode('redteam');

// Same data, different perspective
await agent.chat('What are the attack vectors?');

// Conversation history preserved across mode switches
```

**Validating mode names:**
```typescript
const validModes: AgentMode[] = [
  'base',
  'redteam',
  'blueteam',
  'desktopsecurity',
  'webpentest',
  'osint'
];

function isValidMode(mode: string): mode is AgentMode {
  return validModes.includes(mode as AgentMode);
}
```

## Getting Started

### First Time User Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start interactive session
cyber-claude

# 2. Check your current status
status

# 3. Get familiar with commands
help

# 4. Try a quick scan of your system
scan

# 5. Ask the AI to explain results
What are the most important security issues you found?

# 6. Get recommendations
What should I do first to improve my security?
```

### Understanding Modes

Before diving into workflows, understand that **modes change how the AI thinks**:

- **base** ü§ñ - General assistant, good for learning
- **redteam** ‚öîÔ∏è - Thinks like an attacker (finding vulnerabilities)
- **blueteam** üõ°Ô∏è - Thinks like a defender (monitoring, responding)
- **desktopsecurity** üîí - Focused on personal computer security
- **webpentest** üåê - Web application security expert
- **osint** üîç - Intelligence gathering and reconnaissance

**Pro Tip:** Switch modes based on your current task for best results!

## Best Practices & Pro Tips

### 1. **Effective Mode Switching**

```bash
# Start broad, then narrow down
mode base ‚Üí mode desktopsecurity ‚Üí specific questions

# Match mode to task
- Scanning? Use desktopsecurity or blueteam
- Testing web app? Use webpentest
- Gathering intel? Use osint
- Analyzing threats? Use blueteam
- Finding vulnerabilities? Use redteam
```

### 2. **Getting Better Answers**

**‚ùå Don't Ask:**
```
Is my system secure?
```

**‚úÖ Do Ask:**
```
scan full
Based on these scan results, what are the top 3 security risks and how do I fix them?
```

**The Difference:** Provide context and data for better analysis!

---

### 3. **Combining Commands with Chat**

```bash
# Pattern: Command ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Specific Questions

# Step 1: Run command
scan

# Step 2: Get AI analysis
Analyze these results for security issues

# Step 3: Ask specific follow-ups
Why is process X running?
Should port Y be open?
How do I close port Z?
```

---

### 4. **Building Context**

The AI remembers your conversation in the session, so build context:

```bash
# Build context progressively
scan
# AI sees system state

I'm running a web server on port 8080
# AI now knows your context

scan network
# AI can correlate with previous information

Is the traffic to port 8080 normal based on what you know?
# AI uses accumulated context
```

---

### 5. **Handling Large Results**

```bash
# For large scan results
scan full

# Don't ask "tell me everything"
# Instead, be specific:
Show me only critical and high severity findings
What's the most important issue to fix first?
Explain the top 3 risks in simple terms
```

---

### 6. **Learning Mode**

Use Cyber Claude as a security mentor:

```bash
# Pattern: Find ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Practice

# Find a vulnerability
webscan https://example.com

# Learn about it
Explain what CSRF is and why it's dangerous
How does CSRF protection work?

# Practice preventing it
How do I implement CSRF protection in [your framework]?
Show me code examples
```

---

### 7. **Documentation Workflow**

```bash
# Use AI to help document findings

scan full

Create a security audit report with:
1. Executive summary
2. Critical findings
3. Remediation roadmap
4. Technical details

# Or for bug bounties
Create a vulnerability report for [finding] in bug bounty format
```

---

### 8. **Using History Effectively**

```bash
# Check what you've done
history

# Reference previous commands
status

# Clear context when starting new task
clear
mode [new-mode]
```

---

## Common Scenarios

```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. **Multi-Mode Investigation**

For complex investigations, use multiple modes:

```bash
# Start with OSINT
mode osint
recon target.com --full

# Switch to redteam for vulnerability analysis
mode redteam
webscan https://target.com

# Switch to blueteam for defensive recommendations
mode blueteam
Based on these vulnerabilities, what detections should be implemented?
```

---

### 2. **Iterative Testing**

```bash
mode webpentest

# Initial test
webscan https://app.com

# Get list of endpoints
What endpoints should I test more thoroughly?

# Test each endpoint
webscan https://app.com/api/users
webscan https://app.com/admin

# Compare results
What's the most critical vulnerability across all endpoints?
```

---

### 3. **Creating Custom Workflows**

```bash
# Save your effective workflows in scripts
# Example: daily security check

scan
scan network
harden
Summarize any new security concerns compared to yesterday
```

# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

## Setup (2 minutes)

### 1. Set up your API keys

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys
nano .env
```

In `.env`, set (at least one required):
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-key-here    # Get at: https://console.anthropic.com/
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...                          # Get at: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
```

### 2. Install and Build

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## Try It Out! üéØ

### View the Welcome Screen
```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll see:
- üé® Beautiful ASCII art banner with gradient colors
- üõ°Ô∏è Security shield showing "Safe Mode"
- üìã Quick command reference

### Quick Security Check
```bash
npm run dev -- scan --quick
```

This performs a rapid security assessment of your system:
- Checks for high CPU processes
- Identifies listening ports
- Detects external network connections
- AI analysis of findings

### Full System Scan
```bash
npm run dev -- scan
```

Comprehensive security scan with AI-powered analysis:
- System information
- Running processes and services
- Network connections
- Storage information
- User sessions

### Check System Hardening
```bash
npm run dev -- harden
```

Evaluates your security posture:
- Firewall status (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Disk encryption (FileVault, LUKS, BitLocker)
- Security features (Gatekeeper, SELinux, etc.)
- Running services analysis
- AI-powered recommendations

### Web Application Security Scan (NEW!)
```bash
# Quick web security scan
npm run dev -- webscan https://example.com

# Full vulnerability scan
npm run dev -- webscan --full https://myapp.local

# CTF challenge mode
npm run dev -- webscan --ctf https://ctf.example.com
```

Tests web applications for:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Security header misconfigurations
- Cookie security issues
- CSRF protection
- Form security
- Information disclosure

**Note**: Authorization required before scanning. Only test systems you own or have permission to test!

### Interactive Chat Mode
```bash
npm run dev -- chat
```

Start chatting with Cyber Claude:
- Ask security questions
- Get real-time analysis
- Switch between modes (redteam, blueteam, desktopsecurity, webpentest)
- Learn about security best practices

**Chat Commands:**
- `/mode redteam` - Switch to red team perspective
- `/mode blueteam` - Switch to defensive operations
- `/mode desktopsecurity` - Focus on personal security
- `/mode webpentest` - Web application security testing (NEW!)
- `/clear` - Clear conversation history
- `/exit` - Exit chat

### Try Different Modes
```bash
# Red Team mode (offensive security perspective)
npm run dev -- chat --mode redteam

# Blue Team mode (defensive operations)
npm run dev -- chat --mode blueteam

# Desktop Security mode (personal computer)
npm run dev -- chat --mode desktopsecurity

# Web Pentest mode (web application security)
npm run dev -- chat --mode webpentest
```

## Example Interactions

### Ask About Your System
```
You: What security issues should I be most concerned about on macOS?

Cyber Claude: [Provides detailed analysis of macOS security considerations]
```

### Analyze a Specific Issue
```
You: I have port 8080 open. Is this a security risk?

Cyber Claude: [Analyzes the port and provides context-specific advice]
```

### Get Hardening Recommendations
```
You: What are the top 5 things I should do to harden my system?

Cyber Claude: [Provides prioritized, actionable recommendations]
```

## Export Reports

Save your scan results:

```bash
# Export to JSON
npm run dev -- scan --json report.json

# Export to Markdown
npm run dev -- scan --md report.md

# Both formats
npm run dev -- scan --json report.json --md report.md
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Run with elevated privileges** (when safe):
   ```bash
   sudo npm run dev -- scan
   ```
   This allows more comprehensive security checks (firewall, encryption status, etc.)

2. **Be specific in chat mode**:
   - ‚úÖ "Analyze my network connections for suspicious activity"
   - ‚úÖ "Check if my SSH configuration is secure"
   - ‚ùå "Check everything" (too broad)

3. **Use the right mode**:
   - **base**: General security assistant
   - **redteam**: Finding vulnerabilities, attack surface analysis
   - **blueteam**: Threat detection, incident response
   - **desktopsecurity**: Personal computer hardening
   - **webpentest**: Web application security testing (NEW!)

4. **Export findings for tracking**:
   - Keep reports to track improvements over time
   - Share with team members
   - Use for compliance documentation

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key Not Configured"
- Make sure `.env` file exists
- Check that `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set
- Verify the key is valid at https://console.anthropic.com/

### "Permission Denied" errors
- Some security checks require elevated privileges
- Run with `sudo` for full functionality
- Or run as regular user for basic checks

### TypeScript errors during build
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

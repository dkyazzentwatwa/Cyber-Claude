# Cybersecurity Agent Capabilities Research

## AI Agents in Red Team/Blue Team Operations (2025)

### Current Landscape

**Market Context:**
- Cybercrime costs: $9.5 trillion (2024), forecasted >$10.5 trillion (2025)
- Amazon faces ~1 billion cyber threats per day (AI-driven surge)
- Agentic AI is transforming red/blue team operations

### Red Team Capabilities

**What AI Agents Can Do:**
- Automate vulnerability scanning
- Simulate tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
- Probe for systemic weaknesses with unprecedented agility
- Stress-test deployed systems continuously

**Limitations:**
- Cannot replicate human creativity in finding novel vulnerabilities
- Requires ethical hacker oversight for adaptive thinking
- Risk of over-reliance on automated testing

**Key Red Team Functions for Agent:**
1. Automated reconnaissance and enumeration
2. Vulnerability scanning and assessment
3. Exploit simulation (safe/controlled)
4. MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping
5. Report generation with remediation recommendations

### Blue Team Capabilities

**What AI Agents Can Do:**
- Ramp up threat detection capabilities
- Monitor systems continuously
- Analyze threats at machine speed
- Implement automated response measures

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Defending infrastructure
- Monitoring systems
- Assessing risks
- Analyzing threats
- Implementing hardening and recovery

**Key Blue Team Functions for Agent:**
1. Log analysis and anomaly detection
2. Security configuration assessment
3. Compliance checking
4. Incident response automation
5. Threat intelligence correlation
6. Security posture monitoring

### Purple Team Integration
